              <blockquote>
                <p>Let me tell you about the most sweetest little man - Diego. To start, he is the biggest
                  'foodie' I know. He
                  is so chill and never breaks a sweat! He acts like he doesn't know what's up; but watch out! If you
                  cut your pb&j
                  sandwich with a knife, and leave it on your plate - like on the coffee table or something, Diego will
                  be over in a
                  flash! He'll be over and lick that peanut butter off that knife before you finish the last bite! Lol!
                </p>
                <p>He'll wait til Sammy traps a frog or lizard, then - here comes Diego! He'll come running in and bump
                  her outta the way
                  with his big head! Then try to catch whatever she worked so hard on trapping! Ugh! it's non stop with
                  these two. But we
                  love it so much we are writing a blog about it!</p>
                <p>Diego is also highly attentive and always watching his sister Sammy with one-eye open, even when he's
                  'sleeping'. Like
                  most frenchie's, he snores when he sleeps - sometimes even while he is awake. How does he do that? I
                  am not sure if it
                  is his pulmonary stenosis, or his small nose canals... or if he has a dryer nose than most french
                  bulldogs? We usually
                  use a
                  <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NPJJ35G/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=sammyanddiego-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=cac65b9c28c020930499e33e20360ea3&creativeASIN=B00NPJJ35G">snout
                    smoother</a>.. works well for a few days to a week. With Diego we have to apply probably more often
                  then most
                  people do with their french bulldogs. </p>


                <p>Diego, also makes those grunting sounds when he really wants you attention. He does it in different
                  octaves too, so it's
                  kinda like you're holding a primitive conversation with him. What else? Since he is a bulldog - once
                  he is hooked on
                  something, there is no diverting his attention! He is very determined and will not give up without a
                  fight even though
                  he is such a 'chill pill' most of the time.</p>

                <h2>Q & A with Diego</h2>
              </blockquote>
              <hr />
              <h5>What is your pet’s name? </h5>
              <p>A. Diego</p>
              <h5>How did you come up with the name, does it have any specific significance?</h5>
              <p>A. We were looking at a book, deciding on what to name him and when we both pointed at Diego at the
                exact same time!</p>
              <h5>How old is your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. Diego’s birthday is January 29, 2018.</p>
              <h5>When did you get your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. We got Diego (on the same day as Sammy) August 10, 2018.</p>
              <h5>What breed is your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. French Bulldog</p>
              <h5>Where did you get your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. Miami, FL</p>
              <h5>What is your pets’ favorite food?</h5>
              <p>A. I dont think there is anything he wont eat!</p>
              <h5>What is your pet’s favorite game?</h5>
              <p>A. Frog hunting at night!</p>
              <h5>What is your favorite thing to do together?</h5>
              <p>A. 100% Snuggle</p>
              <h5>Do you go outdoors? If yes, where is your favorite place to go together?</h5>
              <p>A. We live in Florida - so it gets really hot for Mr. Diego. During winter months he enjoys the
                outdoors a lot more.
                Favorite place is Food Trucks at Downtown Windermere, FL</p>
              <h5>What is a bad habit that your pet has?</h5>
              <p>A. Diego has a bad habit of eating poop. His poop, his sisters poop, poop just sitting in the grass.
                It’s gross and we’ll
                talk about that separately in a blog post.</p>
              <h5>What is the best thing about your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. Diego is extremely photogenic! He was put on this earth to be photographed.</p>
              <h5>What is the naughtiest thing your pet has ever done?</h5>
              <p>A. When we go outside, he typically will walk into any neighbors garage that is open, and check if the
                garage door to the
                house is propped open.. And go into the house and start looking for cat/dog food and start eating it! He
                is on a special
                diet. He gets sick!!</p>
              <h5>What is the funniest memory involving your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. There are lots - but the one that comes to mind first, is when I came out into the back patio and
                saw a lizard hanging
                from Diego’s mouth. I said “No, leave it” (Our command word for drop it), but after I got closer, the
                lizard bit onto
                Diego. Onto his lip and Diego didnt know what to do!! Hahah I have a clip of Diego being bit by a
                lizard.
                <a style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/fT7IDsQM4mU">See the video
                  here!</a>
              </p>
              <h5>What is the best memory involving your pet?</h5>
              <p>A. The best memory is when we sent Sammy to doggie k9 training and Diego had the house all to himself.
                He really came out of
                his shell when Sam was gone. I was surprised how much personality he had. He started doing things he
                never did when
                Sammy was here. She is the spark plug of the two. So she can be a tad overshadowing for attention.</p>
              <h5>What is the hardest thing about being a pet owner?</h5>
              <p>A. Being a pet owner - a owner of two French Bulldogs, Diego has a grade 5 heart palpitation - so his
                diet and what he can
                eat and keep down is a careful situation at home - especially when his sister can eat anything and be
                fine.</p>
              <h5>What is the most rewarding thing about being a pet owner?</h5>
              <p>A. Diego gives so much love! He is very loyal and your best friend if you just give him a chance.</p>
              <h5>Does your pet have a nickname and what is it?</h5>
              <p>A. Buddy Boy, Diegosh, “Our Big Strong Man”, Old Man Snoozer, Inspector Diego</p>
              <h5>Have you ever thought your pet any tricks if so, what?</h5>
              <p>A. No, Diego is not the trick type of dog. He shines in so many other ways!</p>
